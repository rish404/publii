                <p class="column small left"><span style="font-family: var(--editor-font-family); font-size: inherit;">Whether you're photographing an intimate elopement, a micro wedding, a quirky alternative wedding or a traditional big wedding reception, the right kit is key. So which are the best Canon lenses for wedding photography? What are the essential features to look for in a Canon wedding lens? And which lenses will be both reliable and fast to focus, enabling you to deliver results time and time again?</span></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Canon RF 15-35">Best wide-angle lens</a></li>
<li><a href="#Canon RF 85mm">Best lens for details</a></li>
<li><a href="#Canon RF 40mm">Best lens for isolating the subject</a></li>
<li><a href="#Canon RF 28-70">Best zoom lens</a></li>
<li><a href="#Canon RF 70-200mm">Best lens for outdoor portraits</a></li>
<li>Bonus : My favourite lens</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Canon RF 15-35">1. Best wide-angle lens for immersive portraits: Canon RF 15-35mm F2.8L IS USM</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><a href="https://amzn.to/3V1qwtC"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/Zqbz13gB/gallery-canon-rf-15-35mm-f2.webp" data-is-external-image="true"  width="316" height="316"></figure></a></p>
<p>First of all, let's understand what immersive portraits actually mean. It's a well known fact in the photography and cinema world that you keep your audience where you put your camera (or the lens) at. Which means, when the director or the DoP decides to pan into a shot in film, you feel getting closer to the mind of the character. If the camera is far apart, you feel disconnected and if it's too close, you feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Similarly, in wedding photography, we're always working with human beings. And for the people who see those photos afterwards, it's very important to give them a feeling of immersion like they were actually present there at the wedding, celebrating with their loved ones. This has a great emotional impact and the primary reason why sometimes some of our clients have tears in their eyes when seeing their wedding photos for the first time.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2019/05/AR_Wedding_Blog_001.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal" width="702" height="469"></figure>
<p>Canon's RF 15-35mm lets you do just that. With a flexible aperture, this goes from 35mm to all the way to 15mm. So no matter the number of people in front of you, you can always adjust the focal length to include them all and capture all the drama in a single frame and give the viewer a sense of immersion.</p>

<h2 id="Canon RF 85mm">2. Best lens for capturing details: Canon RF 85mm F1.2L USM</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><a href="https://amzn.to/3CzApHW"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/6qLDjp0L/rf-85mm-f1.webp" data-is-external-image="true"  width="351" height="351"></figure></a></p>
<p>The devil is in the details. And details are the most overlooked while the most essential thing, not only in photography, but in everything else you do in your life. But especially in wedding photography, the importance of details cannot be overstated. After all, the most important things like the wedding ring, all need detailed shots.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/TriciaHemant_Blog_RishPhotography_020.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal" width="702" height="468"></figure>
<p>However, details are not only limited to just objects. Detail can be even human emotions. That tear that is just about to roll off the cheek of bride's mother, capture that detail. That twinkle in the eye when the groom sees his bride for the first time, capture that. That tightness of the hug, the father gives her daughter at the wedding, capture that. And to capture all of this, the best lens, in my opinion, would be Canon's RF 85mm F1.2L USM. Since these details happen for split seconds, you need a very fast lens. The 85mm with F1.2 is the fastest lens in that series which can lock tact sharp focus even in low light situations given the wide aperture it has.</p>
<p class="align-center"><a href="https://amzn.to/3CzApHW" class="btn">Buy Now (Amazon IN)</a></p>
<h2 id="Canon RF 40mm">3. Best lens for isolating the subject: Canon RF 50mm F1.2L USM</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/wxX8Twpy/rf50mm-f-1.webp" data-is-external-image="true"  width="351" height="351"></figure>
<p>There's a very popular term in photography, which I'm sure most of you have heard before. And it's called Bokeh. It's the Japanese word from blur. Specifically, background blur. And what background blur essentially does it to isolate your subject. The subject then stands alone regardless of how busy or distracting the background is and you still can get a great photo. Almost all portraits depend on this background blur or bokeh effect. And Canon's RF 50mm f1.2L USM lens helps you achieve just that very easily.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/07/5.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal" width="702" height="468"></figure>
<p>Have a subject with a very distracting or busy background but still want to make an epic portrait? Just shoot 50mm wide open and you're golden.</p>
<p>50mm is also a very special focal length because it's closer to what our normal eyes see the world in. So, when we shoot portraits in 50mm focal length, it doesn't deform or exaggerate any facial or body features. You get what you see, just in a much more beautiful and artistic way!</p>
<h2 id="Canon RF 28-70">4. Best zoom lens for wedding photography: Canon RF 28-70mm F2L USM</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/hvqk1d9t/rf28-70mm-f-2l-usm-side-1x1-2127c2e2d818432bad9c83bec854360a.webp" data-is-external-image="true"  width="351" height="351"></figure>
<p>Zoom is a great superpower to have. Imagine you never have to move an inch and still be able to capture anything in the line of sight. Well, a zoom lens gives you that power. But with great power comes great responsibility. And you have to really know where to use what level of zoom. Keeping that judgement aside, Canon RF 28.70 f2L USM is a great lens to have with a very wide range of zoom.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2018/05/Puneet_Rahul_Blog_127.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal" width="702" height="468"></figure>
<p>28mm is practically a very wide focal length and 70mm is a very long focal length. There's no other lens in this price range that gives you this much flexibility.</p>
<p>However, the thing with zoom lenses are they tend to be a little bit heavier, more complex and little bit slower. What I mean by slower is, the maximum aperture in this lens is f2 which is quite a bit slower than other f1.2 lenses we discussed earlier.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if this is a tradeoff you're willing to take, this lens is very versatile.</p>
<h2 id="Canon RF 70-200mm">5. Best long lens for outdoor portraits: Canon RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM</h2>
<figure class="post__image post__image--left"><a href="https://amzn.to/3Ey4xF1"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/hGNWhwvx/pro-best-mirrorless-kit-landscapes-boxout-3-86cc10e9070d44d0a04b04075f97a71e.webp" data-is-external-image="true"  width="351" height="351"></figure></a></p>
<p>Although not as long as the average length of an Indian wedding, Canon RF 70-200mm f2.8L IS USM is one of the best long zoom lenses Canon has ever produced. If I have to choose one lens to shoot a whole wedding with, I'd definitely choose this lens. This lens is built like a tank, offers you an exponential range while being an L series lens (L series lenses are classic canons with a red ring, built like a tank &amp; top notch quality)</p>
<p>Why have I referred to this as best lens for outdoor portraits? Because 200mm is such a long focal length, the photographer needs to stand very far away from the subject in order to photograph it. Otherwise the lens just won't focus. But once you get a taste of that 200mm quality, bokeh &amp; speed, it's very hard to go back.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/04/KJ_TajShoot_Mehtab_Morning_059.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal" width="702" height="468"></figure>
<p>Since this lens comes at the maximum aperture of f.28 it requires great lighting to work at its full potential. And what better light source than our good old sun? This is why I prefer this lens while working in outdoor conditions with an open sky and ample of light.</p>
<p class="align-center"><a href="https://amzn.to/3Ey4xF1" class="btn">Buy Now (Amazon IN)</a></p>
<h1 id="title" class="a-size-large a-spacing-none"><span id="productTitle" class="a-size-large product-title-word-break">6. Bonus - Canon RF 35mm f/1.8 Macro is STM Lens</span></h1>
<figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://i.postimg.cc/mZCVHr8h/rf35mm-f-1.webp" data-is-external-image="true"  width="320" height="320"></figure>
<p>This one is a bonus and let me tell you why. The 35mm is a very well kept secret of all great documentary photographers. Why is that you ask? That's because 35mm is the exact focal length of our eyes. Which makes the photos produced by this lens really familiar. Because that's how we see the world with our own eyes!</p>
<p>But this one has one more amazing trick right up its sleeve. This RF 35mm f/1.8 lens comes with macro ability inbuilt.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy"  src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/Neha_Aditya_01.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  alt="Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal" width="702" height="468"></figure>
<p>Which means you not only can create great photographic compositions using its 35mm focal length, but also can get detailed close up macro shots using the macro mode. That's two very expensive to have features in a relatively inexpensive lens. And that too, at a fast aperture speed of f1.8. What more can you want?</p>

                <p>Taj Mahal is an epitome of love. Originally built by the Emperor of Mughals - Shah Jahan in the memory of his beloved wife, Mumtaz mahal, it's one of the seven wonders of the world, situated in Agra, India. What can be more beautiful than getting your pre wedding engagement shoot done at this majestic location?</p>
<p>We offer the <a href="https://magica.in">Best Pre Wedding Engagement Shoot At Taj Mahal</a> in India. We're licensed photographers to shoot there so you don't have to face any issues while getting the photo shoot there.</p>
<p class="msg--highlight msg">Here's why you should consider getting your pre wedding photo shoot done at Taj:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Iconic Location</strong> - There's literally no other location in the world that you can compare with the majestic Taj Mahal</li>
<li><strong>Easy Access</strong> - Agra is just a drive away from New Delhi, which is also one of the biggest international airports in India. You can be anywhere in the world, just land at New Delhi airport and travel to Agra by road or train and get your shoot done!</li>
<li><strong>The Ultimate Heritage: </strong>Taj Mahal is the ultimate mughal monument and it was also called as the "Jewel of Muslim Art in India". So if you fancy yourself in traditional Indian lehenga or anarkali, there can be no better background than a heritage site and that too, Taj Mahal for getting your engagement or <a href="https://magica.in/taj-mahal-pre-wedding-engagement-shoot/">pre wedding shoot </a>done.</li>
<li><strong>Beautiful Surroundings</strong> - The Taj is not only Taj. It has amazing beautiful surrounds like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehtab_Bagh">Mehtab Bagh</a> which is across the river Yamuna and through where, the whole Taj is visible in all its glory. Here's how it looks like in photos:</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/04/KJ_TajShoot_Mehtab_Morning_059.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p class="msg msg--success">Some points which you should also note before you plan for the shoot:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid Fridays - </strong>Taj Mahal is closed for general viewing on Friday. Although, you still can have your shoot done at Mehtab Bagh during early morning or late evening hours, you would not be able to go inside Taj and enjoy its beauty</li>
<li><strong>Sunrise vs Sunset Shoot - </strong>As a photographer, I'd always prefer sunrise over sunset because everything from surroundings to your mood is fresh &amp; we have seen much better shoot take place in mornings instead of evenings. However, evenings also have their own advantage and you can also include the <strong>boating area shoot</strong> in your plan if you're shooting in evening</li>
<li><strong>Check for weather -</strong> Whenever you're planning for your pre wedding shoot at Taj Mahal, it's always a good idea to check the weather updates for Agra. It gets really hot during summers in Agra and we'll recommend you to avoid visiting in peak summer months. Winters might be a better option to get your pre wedding shoot done.</li>
<li><strong>No changing rooms - </strong>Since Taj is a heritage site, you don't have the luxury of changing rooms in or around the area. It's always best to decide the best dresses for your shoot and commit to them. Rest is done by your enthusiasm 😄</li>
</ul>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2015/12/NK_PreWed_79-Edit.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"  loading="lazy" data-is-external-image="true"></p>
<p class="msg msg--highlight">Permissions &amp; Constraints</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>No Video Shooting Allowed - </strong>Unfortunately, there's no video shooting possible at Taj Mahal. Only Photography</li>
<li><strong>No Props - </strong>You will not be carry any fancy props inside the premises of Taj Mahal. But hey, keep it as natural as you can which is always the best opiont!</li>
<li><strong>No Drone Camera </strong>- Taj Mahal and its vicinity is protected by strict aviation laws and no one can fly a drone around there</li>
<li><strong>Style of Dresses - </strong>Our recommendation as wedding photographers is to choose plain &amp; solid colors instead of anything flashy when it comes to choosing your attires because that looks best in front of the all-white Taj Mahal</li>
<li><strong>Permission Costs - </strong>Other than the entry fee, there will be permission costs if you want to do a pre wedding shoot at Taj Mahal. For details, make sure to contact us today</li>
</ul>
<p>So, if you want to plan a magical <a href="https://magica.in/taj-mahal-pre-wedding-engagement-shoot/">pre wedding shoot at Taj Mahal </a>to be pretty much alive in your memories, well don’t look beyond as we are right here to make your dream shoot a reality. We bet your photos will turn out to be gorgeous and you will be creating memories that you will cherish forever.</p>

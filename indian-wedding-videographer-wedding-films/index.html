If you are planning on capturing your own Indian wedding, we‚Äôll tell you everything you need to know about it!</figure>
<h2><strong>Wedding Photography and Videography in an Indian wedding</strong></h2>
<p>Indian weddings are as much about the culture and social etiquette as they are about the wedding ceremony and reception. Indian weddings also have a very different style of photography compared to western weddings. Indian weddings are predominantly shot in black and white. The <a href="https://magica.in/tags/weddings/">wedding photography</a> and videography in an Indian wedding is as much about capturing the emotions of the loved ones as it is the spectacular sights and sounds. You‚Äôll have lots of candid shots of the guests and the couple as well as lots of portraits of the couple and their families. The best time to shoot the wedding is during the proposal, the wedding procession, the reception, and the speeches. If you can shoot at other times during the wedding, that‚Äôs even better as it gives you more flexibility.</p>

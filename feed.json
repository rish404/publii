            "content_html": "<div>Having a big fat Indian wedding is on every bride's wish list. And why not? Indian weddings are a symbol of grand celebration and one of the most exotic weddings in the world. While you can plan a minimalistic wedding anywhere in the word like Europe, Italy or Paris, there's a certain traditional charm in having a big fat Indian wedding in India itself. And if you're a Bollywood fan, you can choose to get married on the sets of Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><strong>Yes, the place is called Udaipur</strong></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>The modern bride is different. She's smart, intelligent, and high on details. Naturally, she'd want the best <a href=\"https://magica.in/a-suryagarh-palace-destination-wedding-day-2/\">destination wedding photographer</a> in Udaipur for her wedding. And such kind of brides are perfect clients for Magica by Rish Agarwal who's a detailed focussed boutique wedding photography company. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/12/Sneha_Aniket_Blog_252.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Destination Wedding Photographer Udaipur\" width=\"702\" height=\"469\"></figure></div>\n<h2><strong>Why do a destination wedding in Udaipur, India?</strong></h2>\n<div>Indian weddings are long, colourful, and tiring. An average Indian wedding can have a guest count anywhere between 400 and 800 with 6+ events spread across multiple days and sometimes even multiple locations or cities. If you're having guests coming in from multiple countries, you wouldn't want them to get tired with multiple layovers. The best solution for that is to have everything at one place, for which Udaipur suits as one of the best Indian wedding destinations in the country. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/12/Sneha_Aniket_Blog_049.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Destination Wedding Photographer Udaipur\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>One more very important thing is the guest accommodation abilities of the hotels at these destinations. Udaipur has been famous for having one of the most luxurious hotel chains in the world with brands like Oberois, Leela and Taj group at your service. Your guests are bound to feel at home while residing in these hotels. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/12/Sneha_Aniket_Blog_078.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Destination Wedding Photographer Udaipur\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure></div>\n<h2><strong>How to plan a perfect destination wedding</strong></h2>\n<div>There are two ways to go about it. Either do it all by yourself or hire an expert wedding planner. If you're an NRI bride, working everything out yourself remotely might be a bit of a challenge. Even if you have friends and relatives in India, doing everything on your behalf and then co-ordinating every single detail become tiring after a point. </div>\n<div>And here's where you can let go of all the stress and anxiety of your wedding planning and instead hire a wedding planner who will do everything for you on your behalf and give you the <a href=\"https://magica.in/best-wedding-photographer-in-delhi-india/\">best Indian destination wedding</a> experience that you've always dreamt of.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/12/Sneha_Aniket_Blog_101.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Destination Wedding Photographer Udaipur\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Another often overlook area that couple usually tend to overlook is researching the legalities of getting married in a different country. Different countries have different laws. Depending upon your nationality, some countries might require you to stay there for a certain number of days before you get married. So always research these kinds of issues on the planning stage.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/12/Sneha_Aniket_Blog_275.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Destination Wedding Photographer Udaipur\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Also, try to avoid the peak season rush for <a href=\"https://magica.in/best-indian-wedding-photographer-in-toronto-calgary-vancouver/\">Indian weddings</a>, which typically is in winters, during the months of Nov-Dec-Jan and Feb. On these months, most of the weddings happen in India. Venues and good destination wedding photographer are usually booked a year in advance for such busy dates.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Planning a destination wedding might feel like a long distance relationship. You might think that if you're google calendar obsessed and micromanager bride, you will be able to handle every single detail yourself, but something as trivial as difference in time zones can easily leave you frustrated. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/12/Sneha_Aniket_Blog_290.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Destination Wedding Photographer Udaipur\" width=\"702\" height=\"434\"></figure></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>And you will face the same challenge when trying to find the Best Indian Destination Wedding Photographer in Udaipur. Someone with loads of experience, impeccable professionalism and genuine talent. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>We at Magica are an award-winning team of <a href=\"https://magica.in/tags/weddings/\">wedding photographer</a> and filmmakers, having over a decade of experience in shooting international destination weddings across the globe.

The first thing he would do is take an engagement shoot and a pre-wedding shoot to get a feel of how you want to express yourselves in front of the camera. He will also be able to understand what type of pictures are most important to you and your partner during the reception. For example, whether it's family, friends or just yourself and the bride/groom. One of the best ways to tell if a photographer is good is by seeing if they have experience with weddings of different cultures. If they specialize in south asian weddings, then this should give them enough experience to know what types of shots should be taken at different points during your wedding day.</span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/Neha_Aditya_01.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best South Asian Indian Wedding Photographer and Videographer in USA\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure>\n<h2><span data-slate-fragment=\"JTVCJTdCJTIydHlwZSUyMiUzQSUyMnBhcmFncmFwaCUyMiUyQyUyMmNoaWxkcmVuJTIyJTNBJTVCJTdCJTIydGV4dCUyMiUzQSUyMkhvdyUyME11Y2glMjBEbyUyMFlvdSUyME5lZWQlMjBUbyUyMFNwZW5kJTIwT24lMjBBJTIwUHJvZmVzc2lvbmFsJTIwSW5kaWFuJTIwV2VkZGluZyUyMFBob3RvZ3JhcGhlciUyMiU3RCU1RCU3RCU1RA==\">How Much Do You Need To Spend On A Professional Indian Wedding Photographer</span></h2>\n<p><span data-slate-fragment=\"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\">You can find good South Asian <a href=\"https://magica.in/best-indian-wedding-photographer-in-usa/\">Indian Wedding Photographer in USA</a> in all budgets.

There are so many things to think about, such as the look and feel you want for your photos, whether you want someone who is bilingual or has experience with Indian weddings in America, how much experience they have, etc. To make the process easier, let's explore some of the most important qualities you should look for in an Indian wedding photographer. </span></div>\n<h3 data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\">Professionalism</span></h3>\n<div data-slate-node=\"element\"><span data-slate-node=\"text\">Professionalism is the most significant thing you should look for in your Indian wedding photographer.

For one, it poses a challenge of sand and salty water all around (which can always very easy damage your equipment) but it also offers an opportunity to use the sunlight, sand, water all the natural elements to incorporate emotions in the photographers of our couple.</p>\n<p>Here are some of our tips if you're looking to get your pre wedding shoot done at an outdoor beach:</p>\n<h2>Wear comfortable clothes</h2>\n<p>No matter if you're shooting at a beach in Goa, Andaman, Maldives or any other part of the world, and even if the shoot starts as a serious one, it's bound to go more fun as the time goes, and you'll be running, smiling and having a lot of fun with your partner in the shoot. So it's best to be in comfortable clothes so that you're not too much concerned about them and instead, focus on getting great fun pictures!</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/10/thomas-yohei-PMLL435j_V8-unsplash.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Pre Wedding Photographer India Outdoor Beach Shoot\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\"></figure>\n<h2>Use The Contrast</h2>\n<p>A beach is always going to have a lot of contrasting elements all around. Even though, our style of wedding photography is very minimalistic and modern, we always use this opportunity to include the contrasting elements of things like boats parked on the shore or any other element we can find to incorporate in our pre wedding photo shoot.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/10/jonathan-borba-9GkapULEiTE-unsplash.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Pre Wedding Photographer India Outdoor Beach Shoot\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure>\n<h2>Use The Sunlight To Your Advantage</h2>\n<p>This tip is for both photographers and the couples. Use that beautiful sunset light to get the best ever photographs of your beloved. Everyone looks stunning when the light of the setting sun falls on their face. Why not use this opportunity to do some romantic or even dramatic poses with your loved one and let us capture that as a lifelong memory?</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/10/jonathan-borba-GaSmtFJUPuE-unsplash.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Pre Wedding Photographer India Outdoor Beach Shoot\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\"></figure>\n<h2>Be A Super Model</h2>\n<p>And while you're having fun and feeling all mushy, it doesn't hurt to give some <a>poses</a> like you're in a high fashion model magazine. This especially goes if you have hired the <a>best pre wedding photographer</a> you can find because he'll have the perfect experience of not only getting the best <a>intimate pre wedding</a> shots, but also shots like these.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/10/asdrubal-luna-60Lu4wco62w-unsplash.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Pre Wedding Photographer India Outdoor Beach Shoot\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure>\n<h2>It's not always about the face</h2>\n<p>I know, for most of the time, you'd want to have your happy face in your pre wedding photos. But sometimes (in fact, a lot of times) some of the most powerful photos we have taken do not have faces in them. And that's because your body, hands, and legs are perfectly capable of communicating emotions through the photos. And sometimes more than you face ever can. So don't be afraid of getting shots like these:</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/10/joanna-nix-walkup-vgkjJlEj-VQ-unsplash.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Pre Wedding Photographer India Outdoor Beach Shoot\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/10/thomas-yohei-mqRxVOC7GXo-unsplash.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Pre Wedding Photographer India Outdoor Beach Shoot\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\"></figure>\n<h2>Be overly in love</h2>\n<p>This is your pre wedding shoot and this is probably the best time to show the immense love you have to your partner. Be romantic. Do some dramatic poses. Kiss each other. Hold each other. Remember, these few hours are going to give you the photos you're going to cherish for a lifetime.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/10/jonathan-borba-Id4Hvej_w7k-unsplash.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Pre Wedding Photographer India Outdoor Beach Shoot\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\"></figure>\n<h2>Shoot till the sun sets</h2>\n<p>The sun is very dramatic at two times of the day: sunrise and sunset. And most probably, you'll be facing the sunset if you're doing your pre wedding shoot at an outdoor beach. Use the opportunity to the fullest and create dramatic silhouette photos while the sun is setting with your partner.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/10/jonathan-borba-VX2nrLhq4h4-unsplash.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Pre Wedding Photographer India Outdoor Beach Shoot\" width=\"533\" height=\"800\"></figure>\n<p>If you're looking to get your pre wedding shoot done at an outdoor beach location, be sure to contact us.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://magica.in/contact/\" class=\"btn\">Contact Us</a></p>",

Where it's normal to invite everyone we know with their whole family and friends. Where time just lose its significance (we don't think in number of hours) and just how long and hectic Indian weddings can get (think 4-5 days and sometimes across multiple cities)</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>After all, to be the best Indian <a href=\"https://magica.in/best-wedding-photographer-in-delhi-india/\">wedding photographer</a> in the USA, you have to understand the following fundamentals of how to photograph and Indian wedding:</div>\n<h2><strong>Too Many Events</strong></h2>\n<div>There are just so many events across cultures in an Indian wedding. From baraat to pheras. From jaimala to joota chhupai, there are so many events that are so important to be captured in an Indian wedding that an entire encyclopedia might fell short if one has to start understanding everything. Unless someone is born and brought up in the <a href=\"https://magica.in/how-to-plan-an-indian-wedding-a-step-by-step-guide-for-2022-2023/\">Indian culture</a>, it's very hard for them to comprehend the value of each and every ritual and the broader reason behind them. </div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/07/PN_Day2_Wedding_306.jpeg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Wedding Photographer in USA\" width=\"702\" height=\"469\"></figure></div>\n<h2><strong>Everyone is important</strong></h2>\n<div>In no other culture in the world do we have so many guests, where everyone is important. That distant aunt, whom you didn't see after your 5th grade, has to be in the photos. That small kid you never knew existed until now has to be photographed with his family. And naturally, photographers who have had the experience of only photographing American weddings, where with the bride and groom, there are a only handful of people in the family that are there, it's really hard to understand the logic behind this. Maybe there's no logic really, but that's how Indian weddings are :)</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2019/05/Before_After_002.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Wedding Photographer in USA\" width=\"702\" height=\"470\"></figure></div>\n<h2><strong>Nothing is on time</strong></h2>\n<div>It is said that there's a world time zone and there's an IST, a.k.a. Indian Standard Time, but actually it means is Indians are Seldom on Time 🤣</div>\n<div>And anyone who has ever attended an Indian wedding would wholeheartedly agree with me. In my over a decade long career as a wedding photographer, I haven't seen a single <a href=\"https://magica.in/how-to-plan-an-indian-wedding-a-step-by-step-guide-for-2022-2023/\">Indian wedding</a> where everything went on as it was planned and on time. Once, in a wedding which I was shooting, the baraat was 6 hours late. In another one, bride and groom planned for months for a sunset wedding, but on the wedding day, nobody was ready, and the sun set at its convenient time. What would you do in such a situation? And only an experienced Indian wedding photographer would be equipped to handle that kind of stress.</div>\n<h2><strong>The lighting and colours</strong></h2>\n<div>English or American weddings have primarily two colours—black for the groom and white for the bride. Indian weddings on the other hand start at a minimum of 2 million colours. Just look at this photo below and try to count the number of colours.</div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2019/05/AR_Engagement_Blog_095.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Wedding Photographer in USA\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>The thing with colour is, it really depends on what light is falling on it, that what colour you'd see. So if you, as a bride, have spent months of your time and thousands of your dollars in selecting that perfect colour attire for your wedding, but the colours come out to be all off because the Indian wedding photographer couldn't handle things in tough lighting conditions, how would you feel?</div>\n<h1>So here's my recommendation on selecting the best Indian wedding photographer in the USA:</h1>\n<h2><strong>Get someone who gets Indian weddings:</strong></h2>\n<div>This goes without saying. Get someone who specifically has the experience of shooting Indian weddings. AT LEAST 5-6 years of experience. The more, the better. Because that photographer would know how to handle all the stress and unpredictability that comes with an Indian wedding and still deliver amazing wedding photos.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2018/05/Puneet_Rahul_Blog_127.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Wedding Photographer in USA\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure></div>\n<h2><strong>Hire the Indian wedding photographer in the USA who has a full portfolio to show</strong></h2>\n<div>Not some selected photos. Not an Instagram gallery. You really should see a <a href=\"https://magica.in/tags/weddings/\">complete wedding coverage portfolio </a>of a single (and preferably more) Indian weddings. Why? Because that'll show how <i>consistently</i> he/she can shoot great photos.</div>\n<h2><strong>Have an online / in person meeting before hiring your wedding photographer</strong></h2>\n<div>This one is crucial. Despite someone having checked all the boxes above, it's possible that when you actually meet that person or team, you really don't get along with the vibe. You'd not be able to put a finger on the why you feel so, but it'll just be there. And you're going to trust that person or the wedding company for the most important day of your life. And conversely, they're also going to spend months of their life in post-processing and editing of your wedding pictures. So it's really crucial that you both like each other to be able to work effectively.</div>\n<div> </div>\n<div><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/Neha_Aditya_01.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Indian Wedding Photographer in USA\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure></div>\n<div> </div>\n<div>Those are the points I could think of on top of my mind right now.

Best wide-angle lens for immersive portraits: Canon RF 15-35mm F2.8L IS USM</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3V1qwtC\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/Zqbz13gB/gallery-canon-rf-15-35mm-f2.webp\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  width=\"316\" height=\"316\"></figure></a></p>\n<p>First of all, let's understand what immersive portraits actually mean. It's a well known fact in the photography and cinema world that you keep your audience where you put your camera (or the lens) at. Which means, when the director or the DoP decides to pan into a shot in film, you feel getting closer to the mind of the character. If the camera is far apart, you feel disconnected and if it's too close, you feel uncomfortable.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in wedding photography, we're always working with human beings. And for the people who see those photos afterwards, it's very important to give them a feeling of immersion like they were actually present there at the wedding, celebrating with their loved ones. This has a great emotional impact and the primary reason why sometimes some of our clients have tears in their eyes when seeing their wedding photos for the first time.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2019/05/AR_Wedding_Blog_001.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal\" width=\"702\" height=\"469\"></figure>\n<p>Canon's RF 15-35mm lets you do just that. With a flexible aperture, this goes from 35mm to all the way to 15mm. So no matter the number of people in front of you, you can always adjust the focal length to include them all and capture all the drama in a single frame and give the viewer a sense of immersion.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3V1qwtC\" class=\"btn\">Buy Now (Amazon IN)</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Canon RF 85mm\">2. Best lens for capturing details: Canon RF 85mm F1.2L USM</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CzApHW\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/6qLDjp0L/rf-85mm-f1.webp\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  width=\"351\" height=\"351\"></figure></a></p>\n<p>The devil is in the details. And details are the most overlooked while the most essential thing, not only in photography, but in everything else you do in your life. But especially in wedding photography, the importance of details cannot be overstated. After all, the most important things like the wedding ring, all need detailed shots.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/TriciaHemant_Blog_RishPhotography_020.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure>\n<p>However, details are not only limited to just objects. Detail can be even human emotions. That tear that is just about to roll off the cheek of bride's mother, capture that detail. That twinkle in the eye when the groom sees his bride for the first time, capture that. That tightness of the hug, the father gives her daughter at the wedding, capture that. And to capture all of this, the best lens, in my opinion, would be Canon's RF 85mm F1.2L USM. Since these details happen for split seconds, you need a very fast lens. The 85mm with F1.2 is the fastest lens in that series which can lock tact sharp focus even in low light situations given the wide aperture it has.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3CzApHW\" class=\"btn\">Buy Now (Amazon IN)</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"Canon RF 40mm\">3. Best lens for isolating the subject: Canon RF 50mm F1.2L USM</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/wxX8Twpy/rf50mm-f-1.webp\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  width=\"351\" height=\"351\"></figure>\n<p>There's a very popular term in photography, which I'm sure most of you have heard before. And it's called Bokeh. It's the Japanese word from blur. Specifically, background blur. And what background blur essentially does it to isolate your subject. The subject then stands alone regardless of how busy or distracting the background is and you still can get a great photo. Almost all portraits depend on this background blur or bokeh effect. And Canon's RF 50mm f1.2L USM lens helps you achieve just that very easily.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/07/5.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure>\n<p>Have a subject with a very distracting or busy background but still want to make an epic portrait? Just shoot 50mm wide open and you're golden.</p>\n<p>50mm is also a very special focal length because it's closer to what our normal eyes see the world in. So, when we shoot portraits in 50mm focal length, it doesn't deform or exaggerate any facial or body features. You get what you see, just in a much more beautiful and artistic way!</p>\n<h2 id=\"Canon RF 28-70\">4. Best zoom lens for wedding photography: Canon RF 28-70mm F2L USM</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/hvqk1d9t/rf28-70mm-f-2l-usm-side-1x1-2127c2e2d818432bad9c83bec854360a.webp\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  width=\"351\" height=\"351\"></figure>\n<p>Zoom is a great superpower to have. Imagine you never have to move an inch and still be able to capture anything in the line of sight. Well, a zoom lens gives you that power. But with great power comes great responsibility. And you have to really know where to use what level of zoom. Keeping that judgement aside, Canon RF 28.70 f2L USM is a great lens to have with a very wide range of zoom.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2018/05/Puneet_Rahul_Blog_127.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure>\n<p>28mm is practically a very wide focal length and 70mm is a very long focal length. There's no other lens in this price range that gives you this much flexibility.</p>\n<p>However, the thing with zoom lenses are they tend to be a little bit heavier, more complex and little bit slower. What I mean by slower is, the maximum aperture in this lens is f2 which is quite a bit slower than other f1.2 lenses we discussed earlier.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, if this is a tradeoff you're willing to take, this lens is very versatile.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Canon RF 70-200mm\">5. Best long lens for outdoor portraits: Canon RF 70-200mm F2.8L IS USM</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--left\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Ey4xF1\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/hGNWhwvx/pro-best-mirrorless-kit-landscapes-boxout-3-86cc10e9070d44d0a04b04075f97a71e.webp\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  width=\"351\" height=\"351\"></figure></a></p>\n<p>Although not as long as the average length of an Indian wedding, Canon RF 70-200mm f2.8L IS USM is one of the best long zoom lenses Canon has ever produced. If I have to choose one lens to shoot a whole wedding with, I'd definitely choose this lens. This lens is built like a tank, offers you an exponential range while being an L series lens (L series lenses are classic canons with a red ring, built like a tank &amp; top notch quality)</p>\n<p>Why have I referred to this as best lens for outdoor portraits? Because 200mm is such a long focal length, the photographer needs to stand very far away from the subject in order to photograph it. Otherwise the lens just won't focus. But once you get a taste of that 200mm quality, bokeh &amp; speed, it's very hard to go back.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/04/KJ_TajShoot_Mehtab_Morning_059.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure>\n<p>Since this lens comes at the maximum aperture of f.28 it requires great lighting to work at its full potential. And what better light source than our good old sun? This is why I prefer this lens while working in outdoor conditions with an open sky and ample of light.</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Ey4xF1\" class=\"btn\">Buy Now (Amazon IN)</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"bonus\">6. Bonus - Canon RF 35mm f/1.8 Macro is STM Lens</h2>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--right\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://i.postimg.cc/mZCVHr8h/rf35mm-f-1.webp\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  width=\"320\" height=\"320\"></figure>\n<p>This one is a bonus and let me tell you why. The 35mm is a very well kept secret of all great documentary photographers. Why is that you ask? That's because 35mm is the exact focal length of our eyes. Which makes the photos produced by this lens really familiar. Because that's how we see the world with our own eyes!</p>\n<p>But this one has one more amazing trick right up its sleeve. This RF 35mm f/1.8 lens comes with macro ability inbuilt.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/Neha_Aditya_01.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  alt=\"Best Canon Lenses For Wedding Photography By Indian Wedding Photographer Rish Agarwal\" width=\"702\" height=\"468\"></figure>\n<p>Which means you not only can create great photographic compositions using its 35mm focal length, but also can get detailed close up macro shots using the macro mode. That's two very expensive to have features in a relatively inexpensive lens. And that too, at a fast aperture speed of f1.8. What more can you want?</p>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3fAxaXn\" class=\"btn\">Buy Now (Amazon IN)</a></p>",

So if you fancy yourself in traditional Indian lehenga or anarkali, there can be no better background than a heritage site and that too, Taj Mahal for getting your engagement or <a href=\"https://magica.in/taj-mahal-pre-wedding-engagement-shoot/\">pre wedding shoot </a>done.</li>\n<li><strong>Beautiful Surroundings</strong> - The Taj is not only Taj. It has amazing beautiful surrounds like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehtab_Bagh\">Mehtab Bagh</a> which is across the river Yamuna and through where, the whole Taj is visible in all its glory. Here's how it looks like in photos:</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2022/04/KJ_TajShoot_Mehtab_Morning_059.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--success\">Some points which you should also note before you plan for the shoot:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Avoid Fridays - </strong>Taj Mahal is closed for general viewing on Friday. Although, you still can have your shoot done at Mehtab Bagh during early morning or late evening hours, you would not be able to go inside Taj and enjoy its beauty</li>\n<li><strong>Sunrise vs Sunset Shoot - </strong>As a photographer, I'd always prefer sunrise over sunset because everything from surroundings to your mood is fresh &amp; we have seen much better shoot take place in mornings instead of evenings. However, evenings also have their own advantage and you can also include the <strong>boating area shoot</strong> in your plan if you're shooting in evening</li>\n<li><strong>Check for weather -</strong> Whenever you're planning for your pre wedding shoot at Taj Mahal, it's always a good idea to check the weather updates for Agra. It gets really hot during summers in Agra and we'll recommend you to avoid visiting in peak summer months. Winters might be a better option to get your pre wedding shoot done.</li>\n<li><strong>No changing rooms - </strong>Since Taj is a heritage site, you don't have the luxury of changing rooms in or around the area. It's always best to decide the best dresses for your shoot and commit to them. Rest is done by your enthusiasm 😄</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2015/12/NK_PreWed_79-Edit.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"  loading=\"lazy\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight\">Permissions &amp; Constraints</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Video Shooting Allowed - </strong>Unfortunately, there's no video shooting possible at Taj Mahal. Only Photography</li>\n<li><strong>No Props - </strong>You will not be carry any fancy props inside the premises of Taj Mahal. But hey, keep it as natural as you can which is always the best opiont!</li>\n<li><strong>No Drone Camera </strong>- Taj Mahal and its vicinity is protected by strict aviation laws and no one can fly a drone around there</li>\n<li><strong>Style of Dresses - </strong>Our recommendation as wedding photographers is to choose plain &amp; solid colors instead of anything flashy when it comes to choosing your attires because that looks best in front of the all-white Taj Mahal</li>\n<li><strong>Permission Costs - </strong>Other than the entry fee, there will be permission costs if you want to do a pre wedding shoot at Taj Mahal.

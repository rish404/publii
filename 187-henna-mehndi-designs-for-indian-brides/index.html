Well, thanks to us you will now have one less thing to worry about, your bridal mehndi designs. Read this handy piece of information and know all about the different mehndi designs that are hot this wedding season that you can flaunt.<p></p><h2>Mehndi &amp; Henna: Origin &amp; Significance</h2><p>The Hindi word 'Mehndi' is the definitive art of applying henna to the hands of both men and women. Being home to the Indian sensibilities for centuries now, the application of henna on the hands of a bride-to-be and a groom-to-be is considered an auspicious tradition that falls two days before the wedding ceremony. Primarily used for weddings, festivities and celebrations, applying mehndi patterns is seen as a sacred pre-wedding ritual that all Hindu and vis-a-vis other cultures since time immemorial have been incorporating if their pre-wedding festivities.</p><h3>1.

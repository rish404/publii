But that should be always the case and not the case. I‚Äôve been a part of a few weddings &amp; have seen all forms of weddings &amp; I can say that the wedding planning is indeed very difficult! But it is very important to get your wedding plan right.</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">The process of planning a wedding is really very simple, but you should know what are the details you need to take care of in order to make your wedding successful. A lot of couples think that they have everything planned and they don‚Äôt take care of any little detail that may lead to a disaster!</p><p>I will be sharing with you some things to keep in mind when planning your Indian Wedding. And how you can ensure that the entire day goes well &amp; has the proper amount of fun! Read on:</p><p><strong>1. Figure out Guest List</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2019/05/AR_Wedding_Blog_109.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>The first thing to do is to figure out your guest list. I have seen many people who don‚Äôt invite anyone &amp; they go with the flow of what their family wants. But you shouldn‚Äôt do that because your wedding is all about you &amp; your partner &amp; it should be a special day for the two of you.</p><p>Too many guests can make things difficult for the couple so try to keep it as small as possible, but if you want to invite more people then do it! It shouldn‚Äôt be a problem at all!</p><p><strong>2. Create a Budget:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/07/PN_Day2_Wedding_306.jpeg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>A budget is something that every Indian couple should have before planning their wedding. You can create a budget by using some online tools or by creating a spreadsheet and plotting out all the expenses that you would need for your wedding.For example, you might have to allot some budget for the <a href="https://magica.in">best wedding photographer</a> you can find. This will help in getting an idea of how much money you would need for the entire process from planning, decorating everything till the end of your wedding. Also, it will help in saving some money too which might be useful when planning your budget!</p><p><strong>3. Decide on Decorations:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2019/05/AR_Wedding_Blog_024.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>Choosing the right kind of decorations can make or break your wedding! You might want to use colors similar to your wedding theme, such as white and pink, or you might want to combine two of your favorite colors into one piece of decor, such as using white and red together in your wedding cake or using white flowers with a pink design! Choosing the right colors for your wedding decorations will help make your wedding look very special! Decorating an Indian Wedding is not very difficult but it requires good planning and organisation, which should be done before starting anything else to avoid any last-minute changes or additions!</p><p><strong>4. Decide on your Wedding Theme:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2019/05/AR_Engagement_Blog_095.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>Deciding on a wedding theme is important as it will help you in selecting the right colour schemes, style and other things which will decide how your wedding will look like! A lot of people choose to go with their cultural background when planning their Indian Wedding theme. For example, if you are planning an Indian Wedding then you can go with Indian cultural themes like Rajasthani, Gujarati or Punjabi etc. You can also match the colour scheme of your wedding theme to the colour scheme of your outfit if you want!</p><p><strong>5. Decide on Your Outfit:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/NK_Day2_440-Edit.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>Choosing the right outfit for your wedding is also very important because it will be the first thing that people see when they come to attend your wedding! You should try to pick out something that fits in with all the colours that you have chosen for your wedding theme. Also, think about whether you would like to wear a sari or a lehenga? The answer is both! There are many different types of saris and lehengas available in different colours and styles and it is up to you which one suits you best!</p><p><strong>6. Decide on Your Colour Scheme:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/TriciaHemant_Blog_RishPhotography_031.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>Colour schemes play a very important role in Indian weddings as it helps in choosing the right clothes and colours for all guests who are attending your wedding. It is always good to have more than one colour scheme at a time so that guests get more options if something goes wrong with their first pick. You can consider having two colour schemes or go for a combination of colours. A great deal of thought has been put into choosing the right colours for your wedding. Choose the right pair of shoes and your wedding outfit will go a long way in setting the right ambience for your guests to enjoy</p><p><strong>7. Decide on the Theme:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/Neha_Aditya_01.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>Now that you have all the colours and styles of clothes that you want to wear, it is time to choose a theme! A wedding theme provides a great opportunity for you to create a story or atmosphere for your wedding. You can choose one of the many themes available in India such as Punjabi, Gujarati, Rajasthani and many more!</p><p><strong>8. Think About Your Guests:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2017/11/TriciaHemant_Blog_RishPhotography_016.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>The guests who are going to be attending your wedding are also very important in deciding which theme you should pick and what type of clothes you should wear. If some of your guests are from different parts of India or even from different countries then it is important that they all look good at the same time and don't clash with each other! It is also good if all your guests can be able to dress according to their culture and not just accept anything that you decide for them because it will ruin their culture completely! It is important that everyone looks good at your wedding whether they are Indian or not so try not to make people feel uncomfortable by asking them what type of clothes they would like to wear. If some people cannot afford nice clothes then try not to make them feel uncomfortable by asking them what they would like instead because it will be very embarrassing for all those who cannot afford nice clothes!</p><p><strong>9. Make Sure You Appreciate All The Different Types Of People:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2019/05/AR_Wedding_Blog_116.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>It is important that your guests appreciate all types of people because there are so many different types of people in the world and everyone has their own way of doing things! For example, some people might love wearing traditional clothes while others might love wearing modern clothes while others might love wearing western clothes while others might even love wearing eastern clothes and so on! It is important that everyone appreciates these different types of people because if they don't then it can cause a lot of problems in the future!</p><p><strong>10. Just enjoy your wedding</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.rishabhagarwal.com/wp-content/new-uploads/2019/05/Before_After_002.jpg" data-is-external-image="true"></p><p>and you will have a wonderful time!</p><p class="msg msg--highlight">Weddings are always very important and they are also very fun! However, it is very important that you make sure that your wedding is a success and that everyone enjoys themselves! If you do this then you will have a wonderful time and then the wedding will be a success!</p><p>Do not worry about anything because if you concentrate on having fun then it will be amazing! Try not to worry too much about what people might think about the way you are planning because no one can tell how you feel inside so just enjoy yourself and everything will be fine! It is important that everyone enjoys themselves because if they don't then it will cause problems in the future!</p><p>Just enjoy your wedding</p><p>and everything will be fine.</p><p>¬†</p><p>¬†</p><p>¬†</p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__tag-share"><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fmagica.in%2Fhow-to-plan-an-indian-wedding-a-step-by-step-guide-for-2022-2023%2F" class="js-share facebook" aria-label="Share with Facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://magica.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> </a><a href="https://twitter.com/share?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmagica.in%2Fhow-to-plan-an-indian-wedding-a-step-by-step-guide-for-2022-2023%2F&amp;via=%40rish404&amp;text=How%20to%20Plan%20an%20Indian%20Wedding%20-%20A%20Step%20by%20Step%20Guide%20for%202022-2023" class="js-share twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" aria-label="Share with Twitter" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://magica.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#twitter"/></svg> </a><a href="https://api.whatsapp.com/send?text=How%20to%20Plan%20an%20Indian%20Wedding%20-%20A%20Step%20by%20Step%20Guide%20for%202022-2023 https%3A%2F%2Fmagica.in%2Fhow-to-plan-an-indian-wedding-a-step-by-step-guide-for-2022-2023%2F" class="js-share whatsapp" aria-label="Share with WhatsApp" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg><use xlink:href="https://magica.in/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#whatsapp"/></svg></a></div></div></footer></div></article><div class="post__related"><h3 class="post__related__title">Related posts</h3><div class="l-grid l-grid--3"><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><figure class="c-card__image is-img-loading"><img src="https://magica.in/media/posts/16/JM_Wedding_Day2__416.jpg" srcset="https://magica.in/media/posts/16/responsive/JM_Wedding_Day2__416-xs.jpg 384w, https://magica.in/media/posts/16/responsive/JM_Wedding_Day2__416-sm.jpg 600w, https://magica.in/media/posts/16/responsive/JM_Wedding_Day2__416-md.jpg 768w, https://magica.in/media/posts/16/responsive/JM_Wedding_Day2__416-lg.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 8vw, 33vw" loading="lazy" height="1333" width="2000" alt=""></figure><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://magica.in/a-suryagarh-palace-destination-wedding-day-2/" class="invert">A Suryagarh Palace Destination Wedding - Day 2</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><a href="https://magica.in/tags/weddings/" class="c-card__tag">Weddings</a></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><figure class="c-card__image is-img-loading"><img src="https://magica.in/media/posts/15/JMDay1_RishPhotography_Blog_070.jpg" srcset="https://magica.in/media/posts/15/responsive/JMDay1_RishPhotography_Blog_070-xs.jpg 384w, https://magica.in/media/posts/15/responsive/JMDay1_RishPhotography_Blog_070-sm.jpg 600w, https://magica.in/media/posts/15/responsive/JMDay1_RishPhotography_Blog_070-md.jpg 768w, https://magica.in/media/posts/15/responsive/JMDay1_RishPhotography_Blog_070-lg.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 8vw, 33vw" loading="lazy" height="1333" width="2000" alt=""></figure><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://magica.in/a-suryagarh-palace-destination-wedding-day-1/" class="invert">A Suryagarh Palace Destination Wedding Day 1</a></h2></header><footer class="c-card__meta"><a href="https://magica.in/tags/weddings/" class="c-card__tag">Weddings</a></footer></div></div></article><article class="c-card"><div class="c-card__wrapper"><figure class="c-card__image is-img-loading"><img src="https://magica.in/media/posts/14/Sarika_Krishan_Blog_RishPhotography_025.jpg" srcset="https://magica.in/media/posts/14/responsive/Sarika_Krishan_Blog_RishPhotography_025-xs.jpg 384w, https://magica.in/media/posts/14/responsive/Sarika_Krishan_Blog_RishPhotography_025-sm.jpg 600w, https://magica.in/media/posts/14/responsive/Sarika_Krishan_Blog_RishPhotography_025-md.jpg 768w, https://magica.in/media/posts/14/responsive/Sarika_Krishan_Blog_RishPhotography_025-lg.jpg 1200w" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 8vw, 33vw" loading="lazy" height="1309" width="2000" alt=""></figure><div class="c-card__content"><header><h2 class="c-card__title"><a href="https://magica.in/sarika-and-krishan-pre-wedding/" class="invert">Sarika &amp;
